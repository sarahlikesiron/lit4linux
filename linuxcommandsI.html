                    Ls is a command to list things on your machine such as files and directories.
                    Typing the command “ls” will display the files and folders of the directory you are in.

                    Cd is a command to change the directory. 
                    You enter “cd” followed by the directory or file path and it will take you inside that directory. 
                    For example, say you want to change directories to “Desktop” because you want to view the files there. 
                    You can do the command “cd Desktop” to change your location to the “Desktop” directory. 
                </p>

                    Man is the manual command. 
                    This is used when you want some additional information on a particular command and how it works. 
                    Say for example I want to learn more about the “ls” command. 
                    I would enter the command “man ls” and see a manual written explaining “ls”.

                    Pwd stands for print working directory. 
                    It is helpful when you are changing directories a lot and want to know where you are within the directory structure. 
                    Simply enter the command “pwd” and CentOS will display what directory you are in.

                    Enter this command followed by the name you wish to name the directory and it will make it. 
                    Example) “mkdir folder1”. You can also verify it was created using the ls command again to list out your files and directories.

                    Rmdir is short for remove directory. 
                    Say we want to delete a directory, enter the command “rmdir” followed by the name of the directory. 
                    For example say we want to delete the folder1 directory we just created. 
                    We would enter the command “rmdir folder1”. 
                    Then we can verify it was removed by doing the ls command again and illustrating that folder1 is no longer there.

                For example, enter the command “touch file1.txt” to create a text file named file1.

                Rm is the command to remove files, not directories. 
                We would use this command if we wanted to delete a file on our machine. 
                For example, say we want to delete file1.txt we would enter the command “rm file1.txt”. 
                You can also verify it was deleted by using the “ls” command and seeing that file1.txt no longer exists.

                You can use the command to change the directories of a file. 
                Example: “mv file1.txt Desktop” moves file1.txt to the Desktop directory. 
                We can verify it was moved by changing our directory to Desktop using the command “cd Desktop” then listing the contents of Desktop using “ls”. 
                We should now see the file1.txt.
