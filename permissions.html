                <h1> User, Group, and File Permissions Management </h1>
                <p class="text-commands1">
                    As mentioned in other parts of this site, one of the main focuses of the LinuxOS is security. 
                    Security plays a large role in operating system to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and reliability of data. 
                    One aspect of security in LinuxOS is demonstrated through its use of ownership and permissions.
                </p>
                <p class="text-commands1">
                    Every file and directory on a Linux System is assigned 3 types of ownership, with the ability for different permissions for each. 
                    The three types of owners for files and directories in Linux are a User, Group, and Other.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="textBox">
                <h3>User</h3>
                <p class="text-commands1">
                    A user is the owner of the file. By default, the person who created a file is the user or owner. 
                    A group or user group is a collection of multiple users.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="textBox">
                <h3>Groups</h3>
                <p class="text-commands1">
                    Groups have specified users added to a particular group. 
                    Instead of manually assigning permissions for each Linux user, 
                    a group can make things easier if you have a lot of people working on a file or directory.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="textBox">
                <h3>Other</h3>
                <p class="text-commands1">
                    Other refers to any other user that has access to a file or directory. 
                    It essentially means everybody else. When you set permissions for this type of owner you are setting permissions for the rest of the world.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="textBox">
                <p class="text-commands1">
                    Now that we understand the types of ownership for Linux files and directories we can set permissions for each one. 
                    Permissions dictate what actions can be done to a particular file or directory. 
                    Like owners, there are 3 types of permissions that can be assigned.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="textBox">
                <p class="text-commands1">
                    <strong>Read: </strong>refers to a permission that allows somebody to open and read or look at a file.
                </p>
                <p class="text-commands1">
                    <strong>Write: </strong>refers to the permission that allows somebody to modify the contents of a file and make changes. 
                    The write permission on a directory allows somebody to add, remove, and rename files in a stored directory.
                </p>
                <p class="text-commands1">
                    <strong>Execute: </strong>refers to the permission in which you can run a file. 
                    Say you have a program or a script you have the file for and you want to run the program or script. 
                    The execute permission allows you to run that file on your system.
                </p>

                <p class="text-commands1">
                    Let's see this in action!
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="textBox">
                <p class="text-commands1">
                    Try entering the list command we know and love but with -ls after it in our Linux Terminal. 
                    The full command should look like this “ls -l”. This command lists all the files but the -l adds on the permissions of each file in the list. 
                    Look at the example below of the file1.txt on our machine.
                </p>
                <img src="assets/images/rw.png" alt="Read Write Execute" class="lesson-img">
                <p class="text-commands1">
                    On the left hand side we see the file permissions for this particular file. 
                    The -rw-rw-r— is our permissions for this file and can be viewed in chunks. 
                    Each chunk separated by a “-” represents a different owner. 
                    The first chunk always represents the “User”, the second chunk always represents the “Group”, and the third chunk always represents the “Other”.
                </p>
                <p class="text-commands1">
                    Now that we know the corresponding owner for each chunk we can assess what permissions each owner has. 
                    “r” refers to the permission of reading the file. “w” refers to the permission of writing the file. 
                    “w” refers to the permission of executing a file. When you see rw together that means that this group has both read and write permissions.
                </p>
                <p class="text-commands1">
                    So, let’s break this example down:
                    Since the first chunk is rw, that means the User or owner of the file can both read and write
                    The second chunk is also rw, that means the Group can both read and write the file.
                    The third chunk is just r, that means the Other or everybody else can only read the file.                         
                </p>
