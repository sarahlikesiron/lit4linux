                <h3>Find</h3>
                <img src="assets/images/find.png" alt="Find Command" class="lesson-img">
                <p class="text-commands1">
                    The find command allows you to search for files in the given directory. 
                    This command is performed hierarchically meaning it starts at the parent directory and moves down to sub-directories within the parent. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-commands1"> 
                    A scenario this command might be used is when you want to find all files with the .txt file extension. 
                    The command would be “find *.txt”. Note the * in the command is a wildcard meaning that in the space where it is - any text may be there. 
                    So, it would find any file regardless of name with the .txt file extension.
                </p>
            </div>

                    Yum is command used for allowing users to easily install, update, or remove software packages on a machine.
                </p>
                <p class="text-commands1">
                    Installing a package with yum: To install an application or software use the command “yum install” followed by the name of the software you wish to install. 
                    For example, say you want to download firefox on your machine. Enter the command “yum install firefox”. 
                    Watch it install and enter “Y” for yes when prompted if it’s okay to download. 
                    Be patient as it can take some time to install depending on the size of the package. 
                </p>

                    Enter the command wget followed by the full link for a download of a particular software listed on the link and it will start downloading that software for you. 
                    For example, say we want to download a jpeg file off a website. Enter the command “wget” followed by the website name with the file you want.
                </p>

            <div class="textBox">
                <h3>Top</h3>
                <img src="assets/images/top.png" alt="Top Command" class="lesson-img">
                <p class="text-commands1">
                    Top is a command used to display processes running on the machine. 
                    It also displays some valuable metrics regarding your machine including CPU and Memory utilization.

                <h3>Su</h3>
                <img src="assets/images/su.png" alt="Su Command" class="lesson-img">
                <p class="text-commands1">
                    Su is a command that switches users to the root user of the machine. 
                    The root user is the user or account on a Linux machine that by default has access to all commands and files. 
                    As you continue your journey learning Linux, you will notice that some commands require the root account to enter it.
                </p>
                <p class="text-commands1">
                    Using the command “su” will prompt you to enter the root password. 
                    This is the password you set during the installation process of CentOS 7 on your machine. 
                    After you enter the password you should now be in root mode with access to everything on the machine. 
                    Note: Be careful! Being on root is a security risk as they can do a lot of damage quickly and have access to everything. 
                    This is not a mode you want your machine to be in all the time.
