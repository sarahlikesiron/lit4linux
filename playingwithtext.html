                    Text editing is one feature that can also be done completely from the terminal in Linux. 
                    CentOS and other Linux distributions offer different types of text editors to use within the terminal to write/edit text, search text, save text, and open files. 
                    All of this can be accomplished with different commands in the Linux terminal.

                <h3>Text Editors:</h3>
                <p class="text-commands1">
                    To get started playing with text you first need to choose a text editor to use. 
                    A text editor is a piece of software that allows for the opening of different files and the ability to edit those files. 
                    Linux has many different types of text editors available for use but two of the most popular text editors are vim and nano.
                </p>
                <p class="text-commands1">
                    Vim is a text editor that is native to nearly every linux distribution by default. 
                    Vim is a text editor that is tough to get started with and to master. 
                    t can be difficult and confusing starting out. However, most expert Linux users often choose Vim due to the advanced manipulation and power it possesses.  
                </p>
                <p class="text-commands1">
                    Nano is a text editor that might need to be installed depending on the Linux distribution you are using. 
                    In CentOS 7, nano is installed by default. Nano is easy to use and master as well as intuitive for newer Linux users. 
                    Nano also lists its shortcut commands at the bottom of the screen when open.
                </p>
                <p class="text-commands1">
                    Choosing between these two editors is ultimately up to you. 
                    But for the purpose of these tutorials we will be using nano as it is easier to explain as well as getting started with.              
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="textBox">
                <h3>Running Nano:</h3>
                <img src="assets/images/runningnano.png" alt="Running Nano" class="lesson-img">
                <p class="text-commands1">
                    To open the nano text editor and get started working on a file. 
                    Enter the command “nano” followed by the filename or full path and filename if the file is not in your current directory. 
                    For example, entering the command “nano file1.txt” will open file1.txt in the nano text editor. 
                    Note: if the file does not exist, nano will still open anyways and create the file when saved. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="textBox">
                <h3>Editing within Nano:</h3>
                <img src="assets/images/editingnano.png" alt="Editing Nano" class="lesson-img">
                <p class="text-commands1">
                    Once in the nano text editor screen shown above, you can now edit, add, and make changes to the file that is open. 
                    In this example we have the text file file1.txt open in nano. 
                    From this point we can easily add words using our keyboard and type and make any changes we want within the file.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="textBox">
                <h3>Saving a File:</h3>
                <img src="assets/images/savingnano.png" alt="Saving Nano" class="lesson-img">
                <p class="text-commands1">
                    Once you are done editing the file in the nano text editor you probably would like to save your changes to the file so they are not lost. 
                    To do this, enter the key combination on your keyboard - “control” + “O” then press enter. 
                    This will save your changes to the file open.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="textBox">
                <h3>Exiting Nano:</h3>
                <p class="text-commands1">
                    After you have saved your changes to the file in nano and you want to exit - use the key combination “control” + “X” to exit out of the nano text editor. 
                    You can also see this listed on the bottom of the screen with other shortcuts.
